# JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio
This is a course I have taken from the ZeroToMastery line of courses. This course was called _JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio_. If you are interested in the course, you can find it [here](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects).

I am going to use this repo as a way to gather all the product repos in one place. This way, if you interested in any specific project, you can find all of them in one place instead of searching through my entire GitHub profile.

I have provided a link to the repo on GitHub, which will have a basic description of what the project is all about. I also provided a demo link that will take you to a live version of the project that you can play with and try out.
